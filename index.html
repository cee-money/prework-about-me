      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Two of my close friends are web developers. I'm so intrigued by their day to day work experience - working independently as well as in teams to problem solve. They enjoy their work and are well compensated. They're always learning new skills. I've also noticed while job searching that web developers and full stack software engineers are in high demand.</p>
